      <p id="aboutcontent">Sohail is an undergraduate student at the National Institute of Technology, Goa.
        He is currently pursuing his Bachelors of Technology in Computer Science and Engineering.
        As of today, he has completed one year (two semesters) of coursework.
        A happy-go-luck individual, Sohail considers himself a ‘forever student’ and is eager to build on his academic foundations in mathematics and computer science.
        He is fuelled by his passion for Artificial Neural Networks and Information Security and also enjoys taking up mathematical problems pertaining to Calculus, Linear Algebra and Probability.
        Apart from this, he can be seen spending some time with Web Development.
        He was first introduced to the field of computer programming in his ninth grade, towards the end of which he decided to take it up as a career.
        Today, his vast skill set can be attributed to his constant hunger for knowledge and determination to turn information into action.
        Off the record, he is a sportsperson as well. He has been playing table tennis and cricket for many years and has brought laurels to his school on several occasions.
        Also a civil-aviation enthusiast, Sohail enjoys reading articles which have something to say about recently opened airports or newly designed aircrafts.
        On the musical front, he has been playing the electronic keyboard in order to switch off for a while, and is a vivid listener of Bollywood music.</p>
